MySQL Data Types:In MySQL there are three main data types: 
1. String
2. Numeric
3. Date

1.String: This data type is used to hold string type data. for string, there are some type which are
 as follows

a. CHAR(size):	A FIXED length string (can contain letters, numbers, and special characters). 
The size parameter specifies the column length in characters - can be from 0 to 255. Default is 1.

b.VARCHAR(size)	A VARIABLE length string (can contain letters, numbers, and special characters). 
The size parameter specifies the maximum column length in characters - can be from 0 to 65535.

c.TEXT(size):	Holds a string with a maximum length of 65,535 bytes.

there are more types for string but these three used most commonly.

2.Numeric: This data type is used to hold numeric type data. for Numeric there are some type which are
 as follows.

 a.BIT(size):	A bit-value type. The number of bits per value is specified in size. The size 
 parameter can hold a value from 1 to 64. The default value for size is 1.

 b.BOOL:	Zero is considered as false, nonzero values are considered as true.

 c.INT(size):	A medium integer. Signed range is from -2147483648 to 2147483647. Unsigned range
  is from 0 to 4294967295. The size parameter specifies the maximum display width (which is 255).

 d.INTEGER(size):	Equal to INT(size).

 e.BIGINT(size)	A large integer. Signed range is from -9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807.
   Unsigned range is from 0 to 18446744073709551615. The size parameter specifies the maximum display
    width (which is 255).

 f:FLOAT(p)	A floating point number. MySQL uses the p value to determine whether to use FLOAT
     or DOUBLE for the resulting data type. If p is from 0 to 24, the data type becomes FLOAT().
      If p is from 25 to 53, the data type becomes DOUBLE().
 
 3.Date: This data type is used to hold date type value.for Date there are some type which are
  as follows.

  a.DATE:	A date. Format: YYYY-MM-DD. The supported range is from '1000-01-01' to '9999-12-31'.

  b.DATETIME(fsp)	A date and time combination. Format: YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss. The supported range
   is from '1000-01-01 00:00:00' to '9999-12-31 23:59:59'. Adding DEFAULT and ON UPDATE in the
    column definition to get automatic initialization and updating to the current date and time.

  c.TIMESTAMP(fsp):	A timestamp. TIMESTAMP values are stored as the number of seconds since the
   Unix epoch ('1970-01-01 00:00:00' UTC). Format: YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss. The supported range is 
   from '1970-01-01 00:00:01' UTC to '2038-01-09 03:14:07' UTC. Automatic initialization and updating to the current date and time can be specified using DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP and ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP in the column definition
